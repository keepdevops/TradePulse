1. System Overview\
1.1 Purpose\
TradePulse is a desktop application designed to empower day traders and financial analysts with comprehensive tools for stock market analysis, trading, and portfolio management. The application provides actionable insights through a user-friendly grid-based interface, robust backend processing, and advanced visualization using mplfinance, matplotlib, and plotly. It supports historical financial data from the Redline data conversion utility (converting TXT/CSV to DuckDB, SQLite, or JSON) and live feed data for machine learning (ML) training and predictions. Optimized for M3 Silicon (ARM64) compatibility, TradePulse supports deployment via Conda Forge or Docker containers, with features like real-time alerts, backtesting, sentiment analysis, interactive dashboards, portfolio management, broker integration, cloud sync, and user authentication.\
Target Audience and Use Cases\
Target Audience\
\
Day Traders: Individuals who engage in high-frequency, short-term trading to capitalize on intraday price movements. They require real-time data, volatility analysis, and automated trading tools to execute rapid trades.\
Financial Analysts: Professionals who perform in-depth market analysis to identify investment opportunities, focusing on long-term value and portfolio optimization. They need advanced analytics, visualization, and risk assessment tools.\
\
Use Cases\
\
Identifying Undervalued Stocks:\
Users leverage technical indicators (e.g., Price-to-Earnings ratio, RSI) and ML predictions (e.g., from ADM, CIPO, BICIPO models) to identify stocks trading below their intrinsic value.\
The Analysis and Models Grids provide interactive visualizations (e.g., 3D scatter plots of valuation metrics) to highlight undervalued opportunities.\
\
\
Detecting Volatile Stocks:\
Day traders use real-time data from live feeds and historical volatility analysis (via mplfinance candlestick charts) to identify stocks with high price swings for intraday trading.\
Sentiment analysis from X posts and news feeds enhances volatility predictions by integrating market sentiment as an ML feature.\
\
\
Finding Undervalued Dividend Stocks:\
Financial analysts use the Analysis Grid to filter stocks based on dividend yield, payout ratio, and fundamental metrics, supported by Redline historical data.\
Portfolio Grid visualizes dividend performance and risk-adjusted returns using Plotly dashboards.\
\
\
Developing Trading Strategies to Minimize Losses:\
The Backtest Module allows users to simulate trading strategies using historical Redline data and ML predictions, optimizing for metrics like Sharpe ratio and max drawdown.\
Real-time alerts (via Alerts Module) notify users of price thresholds or risk signals to prevent significant losses.\
Trading Grid integrates stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms to enforce risk management.\
\
\
Budget Management for Trading:\
The Portfolio Grid tracks capital allocation across assets, providing real-time P&L updates and risk simulations (e.g., Monte Carlo analysis) to ensure trades align with budget constraints.\
Users can set position limits and risk thresholds via config.json to avoid overexposure.\
Broker Integration Module supports demo mode for testing strategies without risking capital.\
\
\
\
TradePulse addresses these use cases by combining real-time data, advanced ML models, and interactive visualizations, enabling users to make informed decisions while minimizing financial risks.\
1.2 System Architecture\
TradePulse adopts a modular, multi-process architecture where each module operates as a standalone application, with associated files grouped by logical functions and limited to 200 lines of code for ML models and under 400 lines for other files. Modules can run independently or be linked together via a common menu interface, communicating through a centralized Message Bus. The system integrates with the Redline data conversion utility for historical data and a configurable live feed for real-time data, both used in ML training. To eliminate code duplication while preserving standalone functionality, shared utilities, configuration, and database access are centralized.\
Architecture Components\
\
Message Bus: Centralized communication hub for inter-process messaging.\
Database Layer: Manages data storage and retrieval (SQLite/PostgreSQL/DuckDB).\
Grid-Based UI: Organizes components (Data, Analysis, Models, Trading, Portfolio) in a grid layout.\
Configuration: JSON-based configuration (config.json) for Redline utility, live feed, visualization, models, and environment settings.\
ML Model Files: Separate files for additional models (adm.py, cipo.py, bicipo.py).\
Forward Pass Modules: Separate inference logic for each model (forward_pass_adm.py, forward_pass_cipo.py, forward_pass_bicipo.py).\
Data Sources: Redline utility for historical data and a configurable live feed for real-time data.\
Alerts Module: Handles real-time notifications.\
Backtest Module: Supports strategy simulation.\
Sentiment Module: Performs AI-powered sentiment analysis.\

   [Redline Utility | Live Feed]\
\
Note: Each module is a standalone application, with files grouped by logical functions and limited to 400 lines. Shared utilities in utils/ (e.g., data_validator.py, visualizer.py) eliminate code duplication.\
Code Duplication Elimination\
\
Shared Utilities: Common tasks (e.g., data validation, logging, visualization) are implemented in utils/ directory files (e.g., utils/data_validator.py, utils/visualizer.py), imported by modules as needed.\
Centralized Configuration: A single config.json file, loaded by utils/config_loader.py, provides module-specific settings, avoiding duplicated configuration logic.\
Database Access: utils/database.py centralizes database interactions (e.g., DuckDB for Redline data), ensuring consistent data handling across modules.\
Modular ML Imports: Models Grid dynamically imports ML models (e.g., adm.py) and forward pass modules, reusing code across training and prediction tasks.\
Visualization Abstraction: utils/visualizer.py provides reusable functions for candlestick charts (mplfinance) and 3D plots (plotly), used by Data Grid, Analysis Grid, and Models Grid.\
Message Bus Client: utils/message_bus_client.py (~100 lines) standardizes publish/subscribe logic, enabling modules to communicate without duplicating messaging code.\
\
Module Structure\
Each module is organized as a directory with files grouped by logical functions, all under 400 lines:\
\
Example: Data Grid:data_grid/\
\uc0\u9500 \u9472 \u9472  __init__.py\
\uc0\u9500 \u9472 \u9472  fetcher.py (~150 lines)  # Fetches Redline/live data\
\uc0\u9500 \u9472 \u9472  visualizer.py (~150 lines)  # Renders candlestick charts\
\uc0\u9500 \u9472 \u9472  exporter.py (~100 lines)  # Exports data to CSV/JSON\
\
\
Shared Utilities:utils/\
\uc0\u9500 \u9472 \u9472  data_validator.py (~100 lines)  # Validates stock data\
\uc0\u9500 \u9472 \u9472  config_loader.py (~50 lines)   # Loads config.json\
\uc0\u9500 \u9472 \u9472  database.py (~150 lines)       # Database interactions\
\uc0\u9500 \u9472 \u9472  visualizer.py (~200 lines)     # Candlestick and 3D plots\
\uc0\u9500 \u9472 \u9472  logger.py (~100 lines)         # Logging\
\uc0\u9500 \u9472 \u9472  message_bus_client.py (~100 lines)  # Message Bus interactions\
\
\
Menu Interface:\
main.py (~200 lines): Launches modules as subprocesses or integrates them via the Message Bus, providing a CLI or GUI (e.g., tkinter) menu.\
\
\
\
Standalone and Integrated Operation\
\
Standalone Mode: Each module (e.g., python data_grid/fetcher.py) runs independently, using config.json and shared utilities for data access, visualization, or messaging.\
Integrated Mode: The common menu interface (main.py) launches modules and initializes the Message Bus, enabling seamless communication (e.g., Data Grid publishes data_updated, Models Grid subscribes).\
Example:# main.py (~200 lines)\
import subprocess\
from utils.message_bus_client import MessageBusClient\
\
def launch_module(module_name):\
    subprocess.Popen(["python", f"\{module_name\}/__main__.py"])\
\
def main():\
    bus = MessageBusClient()\
    bus.subscribe("heartbeat")\
    print("TradePulse Menu")\
    print("1. Data Grid\\n2. Models Grid\\n3. All Modules")\
    choice = input("Select: ")\
    if choice == "1":\
        launch_module("data_grid")\
    elif choice == "3":\
        for module in ["data_grid", "models_grid", "trading_grid"]:\
            launch_module(module)\
\
if __name__ == "__main__":\
    main()\
\
\
\
M3 Silicon Optimization\
\
Modules use Conda Forge and the apple channel for M3-compatible dependencies (e.g., tensorflow-macos).\
Shared utilities leverage optimized libraries (e.g., numpy with Metal acceleration) to ensure performance across standalone and integrated modes.\
\
Expandability\
\
The modular design allows easy expansion of any module's capabilities and features.\
Adding New Features: Add new files to module directories (e.g., models_grid/new_model.py for a new ML model), under 200 lines, dynamically imported by the Models Grid.\
Extending Existing Modules: Update module files (e.g., add hyperparameters to lstm.py) or shared utilities (e.g., new function in utils/preprocessor.py) without affecting other modules.\
New Modules: Create a new directory (e.g., risk_grid/), add to the common menu interface (main.py), and integrate with the Message Bus for communication.\
Redline Expansion: Extend Redline\'92s data_module_shared.py for new preprocessing functions, then update TradePulse\'92s utils/database.py to access them.\
Configuration-Driven: Use config.json to enable/disable features (e.g., "models": ["lstm", "prophet"]), allowing runtime expansion without code changes.\
Version Control: Use Git to track expansions, with branches for feature development.\
\
