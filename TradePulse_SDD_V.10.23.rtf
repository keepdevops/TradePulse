1. System Overview\
1.1 Purpose\
TradePulse is a comprehensive trading and portfolio management platform designed to empower day traders, financial analysts, and quantitative traders with advanced tools for market analysis, AI-driven trading strategies, and portfolio optimization. It provides actionable insights through a modular panel-based interface, robust backend processing with FastAPI integration, and advanced visualization using Panel, Plotly, and matplotlib. The platform supports historical financial data from multiple sources (hard drive scanning, live feeds) for machine learning (ML) training and predictions. Optimized for M3 Silicon (ARM64) compatibility, TradePulse supports deployment via Conda Forge or Docker containers, with features like real-time alerts, backtesting, sentiment analysis, interactive dashboards, portfolio management, broker integration, cloud sync, and user authentication. Technical Analysis (TA) capabilities, inspired by John J. Murphy's "Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets," include tools for trend identification, chart patterns, indicators, volume analysis, cycles, intermarket relationships, and rule-based trading systems, integrated with AI for hybrid strategies. Unconventional trading edges (e.g., psychological tilt detection, hidden order opacity simulation) provide unique advantages in emotional control, institutional mimicry, bias correction, signal detection, and long-term patience modeling. Day trader optimizations enhance reliability (data validation), usability (scalping mode, interactive charts), and performance (WebSocket, TA-Lib). Modular expansions include a role-agnostic Data Retrieval Panel, pluggable ML models, charts, formulas, analyzers, data formats, and API streaming. Pluggability is enhanced via PluginManager for runtime reloading, dependency injection (DI) via injector, configuration-driven plugins (configs/plugins.yaml), and observer patterns for flexibility, enabling easy additions/edits without restarts. Standalone modular design ensures each module operates independently with data input/output sharing via BaseModule and a shared data bus (data_bus.py), enforcing <200 lines per file and pluggable options for analysis/outputs. API data streaming is pluggable via BaseStreamHandler. New enhancements make broker integration, cloud sync, user authentication, sentiment analysis, backtesting framework, and real-time alerts standalone and pluggable with dedicated abstract classes (BaseBroker, BaseCloudSync, BaseAuthProvider, BaseSentimentAnalyzer, BaseBacktester, BaseAlertTrigger), integrated with data bus for sharing, UI toggles, and dynamic API endpoints, ensuring extensibility and SOLID compliance.\

\
\
Indicator\
Formula\
Step-by-Step Calculation\
Interpretation/Usage\
\
\
\
RSI\
RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS)), RS = Avg Gain / Avg Loss over 14 periods\

Overbought >70, oversold <30; divergences signal reversals. Module: rsi_formula.py (BaseFormula).\
\
\
MACD\
MACD Line = 12-period EMA - 26-period EMA; Signal = 9-period EMA of MACD; Histogram = MACD - Signal\

Bullish crossover above Signal; histogram for momentum. Module: macd_formula.py.\
\
\
Bollinger Bands\
Middle = 20-period SMA; Upper = Middle + (2 \'d7 SD); Lower = Middle - (2 \'d7 SD)\
1. SMA of closes. 2. SD = \uc0\u8730 [\u931 (x - mean)\'b2 / N]. 3. Add/subtract 2\'d7SD.\
Bands widen with volatility; prices at upper/lower indicate overbought/oversold. Module: bollinger_formula.py.\
\
\
ATR\
ATR = Avg of True Range over 14 periods; TR = max(High-Low,\
High-Prev Close\
,\
\
\
ADX\
ADX = Avg of DX over 14 periods; DX =\
+DI - -DI\
/ (+DI + -DI) \'d7 100\
