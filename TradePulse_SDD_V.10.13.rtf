1. System Overview\
1.1 Purpose\
TradePulse is a comprehensive trading and portfolio management platform designed to empower day traders and financial analysts with advanced tools for market analysis, AI-driven trading strategies, and portfolio optimization. The application provides actionable insights through a modular panel-based interface, robust backend processing with FastAPI integration, and advanced visualization using Panel, Plotly, and matplotlib. It supports historical financial data from multiple sources including hard drive scanning and live feed data for machine learning (ML) training and predictions. Optimized for M3 Silicon (ARM64) compatibility, TradePulse supports deployment via Conda Forge or Docker containers, with features like real-time alerts, backtesting, sentiment analysis, interactive dashboards, portfolio management, broker integration, cloud sync, and user authentication. Newly integrated Technical Analysis (TA) capabilities, drawing from principles in John J. Murphy's "Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets," enhance the platform with dedicated tools for trend identification, chart patterns, indicators, volume analysis, cycles, intermarket relationships, and rule-based trading systems, seamlessly blending with AI modules for hybrid strategies. Further enhancements include unconventional trading edges such as psychological tilt detection, hidden order opacity simulation, personal bias auditing, intermarket hidden divergence fusion, and retail horizon simulation, providing traders with unique advantages in emotional control, institutional mimicry, bias correction, advanced signal detection, and long-term patience modeling. Day trader-specific optimizations strengthen reliability (e.g., data validation), improve usability (e.g., scalping mode, interactive charts), and boost performance (e.g., WebSocket, TA-Lib), enabling faster, more accurate intraday trading.\
1.2 Target Audience and Use Cases\
Target Audience\
Day Traders: Individuals who engage in high-frequency, short-term trading to capitalize on intraday price movements. They require real-time data, volatility analysis, and automated trading tools to execute rapid trades, now augmented with TA-specific features like automated pattern detection and indicator crossovers, plus unconventional edges like tilt detection and opacity simulation for emotional and strategic advantages, and optimizations for stronger reliability, better usability, and faster performance.\
Financial Analysts: Professionals who perform in-depth market analysis to identify investment opportunities, focusing on long-term value and portfolio optimization. They need advanced analytics, visualization, and risk assessment tools, including intermarket analysis and cycle detection for broader market insights, enhanced by bias auditing and horizon simulation for disciplined decision-making.\
Quantitative Traders: Traders who rely on mathematical models and algorithms for trading decisions, requiring robust backtesting frameworks, risk management tools, and performance analytics, enhanced by TA-ML hybrids and hidden divergence fusion for improved prediction accuracy.\
Use Cases\
Identifying Undervalued Stocks:\
Users leverage technical indicators and ML predictions to identify stocks trading below their intrinsic value.\
The Data and Models panels provide interactive visualizations to highlight undervalued opportunities, now including TA trend confirmations based on Dow Theory principles and retail horizon simulations for long-term hold potential.\
Detecting Volatile Stocks:\
Day traders use real-time data from live feeds and historical volatility analysis to identify stocks with high price swings for intraday trading.\
Sentiment analysis from X posts and news feeds enhances volatility predictions, with added TA pattern recognition for breakout signals and intermarket hidden divergence fusion for continuation insights.\
Portfolio Optimization:\
Users employ the Portfolio panel to optimize asset allocation using modern portfolio theory, risk-adjusted returns, and AI-driven rebalancing strategies.\
The AI panel provides automated trading strategies and risk management recommendations, incorporating TA-based risk metrics like ATR for stop-loss placement and bias auditing to correct personal tendencies.\
Real-time Market Monitoring:\
Traders use the Alerts panel to set up custom notifications for price movements, volume spikes, and technical indicator crossovers.\
The Charts panel provides real-time visualization of market data with interactive technical analysis tools, expanded to include automated trendline drawing, cycle forecasting, and tilt detection alerts for emotional state monitoring.\
Technical Analysis-Driven Trading:\
Users apply foundational TA principles to construct charts, identify trends, detect patterns, analyze volume, and build rule-based systems. Integrated with Murphy-inspired features, this use case supports intermarket correlations (e.g., stocks vs. commodities) and money management tools for position sizing.\
Unconventional Edge Utilization:\
Users activate edge modules for psychological advantages, such as detecting tilt via biofeedback to prevent impulsive trades, simulating hidden orders to mimic institutional strategies, auditing biases through journal analysis, fusing hidden divergences with volume profiles for precise signals, and simulating delayed gratification for long-term retail edges.\
Day Trader High-Frequency Execution:\
Day traders utilize scalping mode for minimalist dashboards, one-click trade execution linked to broker APIs, enhanced chart interactivity (e.g., Fibonacci tools, Kagi charts), complex alerts (e.g., multi-condition logic), and sentiment-adjusted TA signals, with WebSocket for sub-second updates and redundant data sources for reliability.\

Detailed Calculations (Based on Murphy's Methodologies):\
| Indicator | Formula | Step-by-Step Calculation | Interpretation/Usage |\
|-----------|---------|--------------------------|----------------------|\
| RSI | RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS)), RS = Avg Gain / Avg Loss over 14 periods. | 1. Calculate daily changes. 2. Separate gains/losses. 3. Initial Avg Gain/Loss over 14 periods. 4. Smooth: New Avg Gain = [(Prev \'d7 13) + Current]/14. 5. Compute RS and RSI. | Overbought >70, oversold <30; divergences signal reversals. |\
| MACD | MACD Line = 12-period EMA - 26-period EMA; Signal = 9-period EMA of MACD; Histogram = MACD - Signal. | 1. EMA: [Price - Prev EMA] \'d7 (2/(N+1)) + Prev EMA. 2. Subtract EMAs for Line. 3. EMA of Line for Signal. 4. Subtract for Histogram. | Bullish crossover above Signal; histogram for momentum. |\
| Bollinger Bands | Middle = 20-period SMA; Upper = Middle + (2 \'d7 SD); Lower = Middle - (2 \'d7 SD). | 1. SMA of closes. 2. SD = \uc0\u8730 [\u931 (x - mean)\'b2 / N]. 3. Add/subtract 2\'d7SD. | Bands widen with volatility; prices at upper/lower indicate overbought/oversold. |\
| ATR | ATR = Avg of True Range over 14 periods; TR = max(High-Low, |High-Prev Close|, |Low-Prev Close|). | 1. Compute daily TR. 2. Avg over period (smoothed similarly to RSI). | Measures volatility for stops; higher ATR = wider stops. |\
