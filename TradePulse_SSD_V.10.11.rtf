1. System Overview\
1.1 Purpose\
TradePulse is a comprehensive trading and portfolio management platform designed to empower day traders and financial analysts with advanced tools for market analysis, AI-driven trading strategies, and portfolio optimization. The application provides actionable insights through a modular panel-based interface, robust backend processing, and advanced visualization using Panel, Plotly, and matplotlib. It supports historical financial data from the Redline data conversion utility (converting TXT/CSV to DuckDB, SQLite, or JSON) and live feed data for machine learning (ML) training and predictions. Optimized for M3 Silicon (ARM64) compatibility, TradePulse supports deployment via Conda Forge or Docker containers, with features like real-time alerts, backtesting, sentiment analysis, interactive dashboards, portfolio management, broker integration, cloud sync, and user authentication.\
1.2 Target Audience and Use Cases\
Target Audience\
Day Traders: Individuals who engage in high-frequency, short-term trading to capitalize on intraday price movements. They require real-time data, volatility analysis, and automated trading tools to execute rapid trades.\
Financial Analysts: Professionals who perform in-depth market analysis to identify investment opportunities, focusing on long-term value and portfolio optimization. They need advanced analytics, visualization, and risk assessment tools.\
Quantitative Traders: Traders who rely on mathematical models and algorithms for trading decisions, requiring robust backtesting frameworks, risk management tools, and performance analytics.\
Use Cases\
Identifying Undervalued Stocks:\
Users leverage technical indicators (e.g., Price-to-Earnings ratio, RSI) and ML predictions (e.g., from ADM, CIPO, BICIPO models) to identify stocks trading below their intrinsic value.\
The Data and Models panels provide interactive visualizations (e.g., 3D scatter plots of valuation metrics) to highlight undervalued opportunities.\
Detecting Volatile Stocks:\
Day traders use real-time data from live feeds and historical volatility analysis (via candlestick charts) to identify stocks with high price swings for intraday trading.\
Sentiment analysis from X posts and news feeds enhances volatility predictions by integrating market sentiment as an ML feature.\
Portfolio Optimization:\
Users employ the Portfolio panel to optimize asset allocation using modern portfolio theory, risk-adjusted returns, and AI-driven rebalancing strategies.\
The AI panel provides automated trading strategies and risk management recommendations.\
Real-time Market Monitoring:\
Traders use the Alerts panel to set up custom notifications for price movements, volume spikes, and technical indicator crossovers.\
The Charts panel provides real-time visualization of market data with interactive technical analysis tools.\
